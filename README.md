# Personal Dashboard

Open `index.html` in your browser. Everything is local (HTML/CSS/JS + SVGs).

Edit mode: click the wrench in the bottom-right.
- Click items to edit their text and URL.
- Click section titles to rename sections.
- A + button appears on each section to add a new item/link.
- Click the top logo or profile photo to replace the image.
- Use the green ✓ to confirm all staged changes or the red ✕ to discard.

Images: the app will try to save new images directly into the project using the File System Access API (you will be asked to pick the project folder). If your browser does not allow this, images will be embedded as data-URLs and still persist via localStorage.
